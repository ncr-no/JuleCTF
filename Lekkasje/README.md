We recently had to fire an employee for gross misconduct against our business. We disabled his access to our file servers immediately, but he's now sending us blackmail. He claims that he has discovered a vulnerability in our website and can use it to access all of our company data. Fortunately for us, we managed to obtain a packet capture of the supposed incident. Can you see if he's managed to steal anything of value?
